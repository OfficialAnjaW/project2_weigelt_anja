				<h2><span>Baby Leia</span> | Hype Girl</h2>
				<p>Nick and Aicha first met working at the German pavilion at Epcot at Walt Disney World in 2010. Since then, their greatest joy in life has been their daughter, Leia. Leia loves to eat all kinds of foods, and her free spirit drives her to eagerly explore the world around her. Being Leia’s parents has given Nick and Aicha new meaning, drive and purpose. When they are working out at the gym, Leia is playing with her friends at the baby gym, getting ready to follow her parents’ path of a healthy lifestyle.</p>
